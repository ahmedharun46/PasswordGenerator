Project Title: Random Password Generator

What was my motivation:     To apply JavaScript to create a random password generator. Where we apply basics Javascript techniques like, function, for and if statements. Learning these Javascripts while help me complete my future work daily. Also this gives me another project I can show off during my interview process in the futre.
